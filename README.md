# Carbonsphere

**Modular Carbon-Based Lattice Architecture for Energy and Memory Applications**

Carbonsphere is a next-generation nanomaterial framework based on interlinked dome-lattice carbon structures. Inspired by buckminsterfullerene geometry and integrated with graphene or conductive substrates, Carbonsphere offers a scalable platform for energy storage, non-volatile memory, and electrostatic manipulation at micro and nanoscale levels.

## Features

- High internal surface area for enhanced charge storage and diffusion
- Dome-lattice structure inspired by partial buckyball geometry
- Compatible with graphene substrates for ultra-fast charge transfer
- Applications in batteries, supercapacitors, memory arrays, and atmospheric harvesting
- Potential for micro-levitation systems using electrostatic repulsion

## Applications

- Energy Storage (Batteries, Supercapacitors)
- Memory Storage (Flash, ReRAM, Neuromorphic Systems)
- Micro-Levitation / Electrostatic Actuation
- Flexible Electronics and Smart Materials
- Atmospheric Charge Collection

## Structure

Each Carbonsphere Sheet consists of:
- Hexagonally open carbon domes tessellated in a modular array
- Charge routing pathways via carbon nanowires
- Optional coatings for battery chemistries (e.g., LiFePO₄, SnO₂)
- Integration-ready base for graphene or conductive substrates
